# Meal Planner

## Overview

Meal Planner is a web application designed to assist managers in creating personalized meal plans for their employees. The application allows meal plans to be created on a **weekly** or **monthly** basis, with filtering options for dietary preferences and allergies. The platform leverages a database of recipes to generate meal options that align with individual restrictions.
